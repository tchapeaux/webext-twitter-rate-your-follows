# Rate Your Twitter

A Firefox extension that lets you rate tweets from your feed, then see an aggregated view by followed user.

This can give you a new perspective on each of your follow. If someone that you follow only posts tweet that you rate badly, maybe unfollow them?

## What does it look like?

See a [demo video](https://youtu.be/LO-yrs13dNg). It's a bit ugly, but functional.

## How to use

This extension has not been submitted, so you need to install it manually.

Clone this repo then follow [these instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#trying_it_out).

## Why did you do this?

This is an experiment that I thought of while scrolling Twitter and seeing people I follow posting stuff that I didn't want to see. The more they posted such content, the less I wanted to follow them, but I wasn't sure when the breaking point would be. I wrote this extension to help me figure it out.

It's also linked to me thinking about [doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) and [social media FOMO](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39129228) and what can be done against it.

## Will there be a Chrome version?

Unfortunately, no. Feel free to port it yourself and propose a PR!
